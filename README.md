# Eye Tracking Software for Basic Home Webcam Setups 
* Open source custom built eye tracking software using Python libraries
* A University of Nottingham Final Year Physics Masters 2-Week Project
* [Link to Project Report](Eye_Tracking_Report.pdf)

### Contributors

* Jason Lunn (me)
* Hugh Baxter

### Using the Code

* Running 'computervision.py' gives a basic idea with GUI on how the eye tracking functions
* The pdf report is a write up of the entire 2 week experiment which goes into further details of the project setup and design

### Relevant Figures

* Still photo of my eye taken via webcam for testing the impact of resolution on tracking accuracy

![Plot to show how accuracy changes with horizontal viewing distance on screen](Resolution_Plot.png "Graph of Accuracy vs Position viewed on Screen")

* This plot shows the change in accuracy due to image resolution quality. The different coloured points represent alternate ways of calculating the centre of the pupil, as outlined in more detail in the Eye Tracking Report pdf file.

### Changelog

* added files with extra comments
